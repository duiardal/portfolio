# Portfolio-website

This projects was made with Angular 7 and Firebase for providing backend service. All the images and its information is collected from Firebase, where AngularFire works as the middle-hand.

The projects shows some of my most recent works that are relevant for web development, game development, UX/UI, and misc.

The reason for making the portfolio somewhat unnecessarily advanced with the use of Angular and Firebase, was to make it scaleable and possible to give to other people who needs a portfolio. This is why it was created like a CRUD-application (Create, Read, Update, Delete), so that it's easy to maintain the website and its content, without touching any code.
